# Embedded and embedding Systems
- *embedded systems* are modular devices that complete specific tasks in realtime
- **typical functionalities**:
  - measuring physical variables (sensing)
  - influencing physical variables (acuating)
  - storing/monitoring data
- **important disciplines**:
  - signal processing
  - control engineering
  - measurement/sensor technology
- as an example, the camera module is an embedded system in your cellphone (the embedding system) 
- **we categorize embedded systems into *product automation* and *production automation***

|                | Device Technology | Programming Languages | Examples |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| **Product**    | **Microcontrollers**, **Programmable Hardware**, Digital Signal Processors | C, Assembler, MATLAB/Simulink, Java | Car electronics |
| **Production** | **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)**, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Industrial PCs (IPC) | IL, LD/RLL, FBD, SFC, CFC | Manufacturing Control, Logistics, Chemical Process Control |


- **similarities** in *product* and *production* automation:
  - requirements for embedded system must be derived from requirements for embedding system
  - strong realtime, safety and reliability
  - rising complexity and quality concerns
- **differences** in *product* and *production* automation:
  - mass production vs unique & custom-made plants
  - resource constraints
  - relationship between manufacturer, supplier, operator and user
  - operation and maintenance
  - device technologies and programming languages

# Microcontrollers
- Peripherals
  - a peripheral is a hardware/device with human readable/writeable input/output interfaces
  - common peripherals are keyboards, speakers, headsets, ...
  - keyboard: user types in a sequence of characters as input, which is then piped through hardware, then to software, to then finally appear on the screen
- Digital I/O
  - PIN
  - PORT
  - DDR
- Timers, Counters, PWM
- DA/AD Conversion
  - Digital/Analog Conversion: PWM, 
  - Analog/Digital Conversion: SAR-Network

# Data buses
- Topologies
- Physical layer - problems and solutions
- Data link layer (Logic link control and medium access controll)
- IÂ²C, CAN, FlexRay, Profibus

# Programmable logic controllers
- Discrete controls
- Languages
- Standard function blocks

# Real time
- Hard/soft realtime
- Deadlocks
- Priority inversion and how to avoid it
- Sporadic and periodic scheduling

# Embedded software design
- Development process models
- Functional requirements
- Quality requirements
- Architecture

# Softwaredevelopment with Simulink
- MATLAB/Simulink
- Subsystems
- Buses
- Embdedded code generation
- Model-based testing
